## Generation Strategy

### For PicLumen:
1. Start with the simpler prompts first
2. Generate multiple variations of each district
3. Pick the best one and refine with longer prompt
4. Use "isometric city map" as a style reference if available

### For Nano Banana / Other Tools:
1. Use the full detailed prompts
2. Add "in the style of Universal Studios theme park map" if it helps
3. Emphasize "professional business illustration" to avoid cartoon style
4. Request "high detail, suitable for zoom"

### Fallback Approach:
If full district scenes are too complex, generate:
- Individual buildings first
- Then composite them together in a design tool (Figma, Canva Pro)
- Or layer them in Mapbox directly
